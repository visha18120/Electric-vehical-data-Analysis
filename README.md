üß† Analytics Techniques Used:
Technique	Application
Descriptive Analytics	Trends in sales, usage, and EV growth
Predictive Analytics	Forecasting future EV sales or charging demand
Geospatial Analysis	Mapping charging stations and EV density
Comparative Analysis	Comparing EVs by specs, cost, and range
Clustering	Grouping regions by EV adoption levels

üìä Tools Commonly Used:
Power BI / Tableau: Dashboards, interactive reports

Python / R: Data cleaning, visualization, and modeling (Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly)

SQL: Querying structured datasets

Excel: Exploratory data analysis and pivoting

üìà Common Use Cases:
Government: Planning EV incentives, policy creation

Businesses: Fleet electrification planning, customer targeting

Manufacturers: Product development, performance tracking

Consumers: Making informed EV purchase decisions

üåç Real-World Insights from EV Analytics:
Tesla leads global EV sales, but BYD is catching up in Asia

Norway has the highest EV adoption per capita

Charging infrastructure is expanding rapidly in urban areas

EVs are increasingly cost-effective with longer ranges and tax incentives
